# Parents Break — Operations System

A staffing operations platform built for a real childcare/transport business, replacing a WhatsApp-and-spreadsheets workflow with a single system: candidate intake → structured interviews → active roster → per-family billing, deployed as an installable PWA with zero infrastructure cost.

**Stack:** Vanilla JS (13 modules, no build step) · Supabase (Postgres, Auth, RLS, Realtime) · GitHub Pages · PWA

## The problem

Parents Break places sitters and drivers with families. Before this project, every stage of that pipeline lived in a different, disconnected place: candidates applied through a Google Form, got interviewed with notes scattered across chats and spreadsheets, and once hired, their contact info and pay rates lived in yet another sheet — with no way to tell, at a glance, who'd been interviewed, who was active, or what margin a given sitter/family pairing was actually generating.

Nothing was queryable. Nothing had access control. Two non-technical staff were manually reconciling records across documents that routinely drifted out of sync.

I designed and shipped a system that collapses that into one source of truth, built iteratively over a week against a live business that couldn't stop operating while I built it — which shaped a lot of the decisions below more than a green-field spec would have.

## What it does

- **Recruitment pipeline** — candidates enter as `intake` (manual entry, or bulk CSV import from real Google Forms exports, with fuzzy header-matching against ~26 real-world form columns that vary in naming), move through a structured interview with weighted, scored competencies + free-text notes, and either get hired into the active roster or stay on record as evaluated-but-not-hired.
- **Family & pricing management** — many-to-many relationships between families and sitters, each with its own hourly billing rate vs. hourly payout; margin is computed automatically rather than tracked by hand.
- **Installable PWA** — manifest + service worker, so non-technical staff get an app-like icon and standalone window on their phone without any app-store distribution overhead.
- **Auth-gated by default** — every table sits behind Postgres Row Level Security scoped to authenticated staff accounts; there is no client-side-only access control anywhere in the system.
- **Incident log & live schedule** — a dedicated incidents table (accidents, complaints, other notable events) linked to a sitter, a family, or a specific job, plus a weekly scheduling view that multiple staff can have open at once thanks to Supabase Realtime.

The frontend has no framework and no build pipeline — deliberately. `index.html` is just the skeleton now: `<head>`, styles, and 13 `<script>` tags loaded in a fixed order. Each script attaches its functions to the global scope rather than using ES modules, since the UI relies on roughly 170 inline `onclick`/`onchange` handlers that call those functions by name, and module scoping would make them invisible from plain HTML. All state and business logic still live in Postgres, not in the client.

Load order matters — `bootstrap.js` boots the app and has to run last:

1. `core.js` — Supabase client, toasts, modals, shared utilities (validation, duplicate-booking checks)
2. `auth.js` — login
3. `app-shell.js` — navigation, the daily dashboard view
4. `finanzas.js` — finance, expenses, margin by family/zone/type
5. `juguetes.js` — toy/equipment inventory
6. `agenda.js` — weekly scheduling view, plus the Realtime subscription layer
7. `contratos.js` — contracts
8. `marketing.js` — marketing
9. `postulantes.js` — candidate/HR pipeline
10. `ninieras.js` — sitters
11. `familias.js` — families
12. `sittings.js` — sittings & transport jobs
13. `bootstrap.js` — app entry point (`boot()`)

This replaced an earlier single-file version once it outgrew what was comfortable to review inside GitHub's web editor. The non-technical staff redeploy workflow — open a file on github.com, edit, commit — stayed exactly the same; it's just scoped to one smaller file at a time instead of one large one.

## Stack, and why

| Piece | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | Vanilla JS, split into 13 scripts, no framework | Zero build step; each file stays small enough to review and redeploy straight from GitHub's web UI; global scope keeps ~170 inline `onclick` handlers working without ES module boundaries |
| Backend | Supabase (Postgres + PostgREST + Auth) | Real relational schema and SQL, instant REST API, managed auth — without hand-rolling a server for a project this size |
| Access control | Postgres Row Level Security | Enforced at the database layer, not the client — the publishable key is safe to ship in public client code because the database itself refuses reads/writes without a valid authenticated session |
| Live sync | Supabase Realtime | Two non-technical staff can have the same view open at once without overwriting each other's changes |
| Hosting | GitHub Pages | Free static hosting straight from the repo; no CI needed at this scale |
| Distribution | PWA (manifest + minimal service worker) | Installable, app-like UX matching actual usage (opened from a phone home screen) without app-store overhead |

## Data model

```
candidatas ──1:N── entrevistas
│
├──1:1 (on hire)── ninieras
│
familias ──M:N (asignaciones, with per-pair rates)── ninieras
│
incidentes (optional link to ninieras, familias, and a specific sitting)
```

**Worth calling out:** the first pass mirrored how the client had been tracking this manually — a candidate got copied into a new record at each pipeline stage (intake sheet → interview sheet → roster sheet). I refactored that into a single `candidatas` table with a `status` enum (`intake → entrevistada → contratada / descartada`) instead, so a person's identity persists through their whole lifecycle rather than being duplicated across stages and risking drift between copies. Interview specifics (scores, red flags, notes) live in a separate `entrevistas` table in a 1:N relationship — that keeps the option open to re-interview someone later without losing prior history, which a flattened single-record model would have made awkward.

Full schema, including the RLS policies, is in [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql).

## Running it locally

No `npm install`, no build step.

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a free [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project.
3. Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](./supabase/schema.sql) against it (SQL editor, or the Supabase CLI).
4. In Supabase → Authentication, manually create your staff user(s) — there's no self-serve signup by design.
5. In `js/core.js`, swap `SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_KEY` for your project's values. The publishable/anon key is meant to be public client-side; the security boundary is RLS, not the key.
6. Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or point GitHub Pages at the repo root for a stable URL.

## What I'd change next

- Move the two Supabase credentials out of a hardcoded constant, if this ever outgrows a single-HTML-file deploy.
- Automate the Google Forms → Supabase step (currently a manual CSV export/import) via a Forms → Apps Script → Supabase Edge Function webhook, so new applicants land in the pipeline without anyone touching a spreadsheet.
- Add tests. Correctness has been verified by hand so far — a deliberate tradeoff while iterating daily against a live client's changing requirements, but one I wouldn't keep making once the schema settles down.
